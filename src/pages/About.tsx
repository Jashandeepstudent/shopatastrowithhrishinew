            <span className="text-foreground font-medium">Astro With Hrishi</span> began with one simple belief — a remedy
            works only when the product is authentic and the guidance behind it is honest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our collection brings together natural crystals, chakra bracelets and traditional Vedic remedy items such as
            the 7 Chakra Tree and Ranga Dhatu Sarp Set. Each item is hand-checked, purified and energised before it is
            packed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We never push a product. Share your details with us on WhatsApp and you will receive a clear, personal
            recommendation — even if that means buying nothing at all.
